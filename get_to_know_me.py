Upcycled jewelry transforms discarded materials into unique accessories, reducing waste and minimizing our ecological footprint. The fashion industry is a major polluter, responsible for 10% of global carbon emissions. For example, mining for new metals and gemstones causes habitat destruction and water pollution. By choosing upcycled jewelry, we decrease the demand for new resources and help protect the environment.")
